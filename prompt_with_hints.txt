/// prompt with no hints for gpt 4 that can view a file
Your task is to generate a set of classification rules based on the sample training data.
The training data is presented in a csv format, and you will view each row of the dataset as one entity and assign one entity to one category.
The first line of the data is the header, which is separated by commas.
The last column indicates the actual label that the entity has, and the rest of the column represent the features.
The following context is given for the training data, wrapped in tripple quotes:
"""
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
Attribute Info:
age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
"""
Your chain of actions should be the following:
1. take a close look at the features and the labels as indicated in the prompt above, and conduct a explorative data analytics.
2. generate a set of statistic and empirical rules that you believe can classify the data.
3. generate python code that implements the rules that you generated above.

The data is provided in the accompany csv.
