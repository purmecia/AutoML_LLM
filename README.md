# AutoML_LLM
Realizing AutoML with LLM

We present a novel method for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our method
asks LLMs to generate a set of empirical rules for classification problems, which can have
applications in important areas such as medical diagnosis. We also identified challenges
for LLMs and identified new avenues for the research of evaluating LLM.
